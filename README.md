Synthesis of the Complete Inverse Kinematic Model of Non-Redundant Open-Chain Robotic Systems Using Groebner Basis Theory

One of the most important elements of a robot's control system is its Inverse Kinematic Model (IKM), which calculates the position and velocity references required by the robot's actuators to follow a trajectory. The methods that are commonly used to synthesize the IKM of open-chain robotic systems strongly depend on the geometry of the analyzed robot, so they are not systematic procedures that can be applied equally in all situations. This project presents the development of a systematic procedure to synthesize the complete IKM of non-redundant open-chain robotic systems using Groebner Basis theory, which does not depend on the robot's geometry. The inputs to the developed procedure are the robot's Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and the movement range of its actuators, while the output is the IKM, ready to be used in the robot's control system or in a simulation of its behavior. This procedure's performance was proved synthesizing the IKMs of a PUMA manipulator and a walking hexapod robot. The computation times of both IKMs are comparable to those required by the kinematic models calculated by traditional methods, while the errors of their computed references were absolutely negligible. The synthesized IKMs are complete in the sense that they not only supply the position reference for all the robot's actuators, but also the corresponding references for their velocities and accelerations, so the developed procedure can be used in a wide range of robotic systems.
